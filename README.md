# DPNNet-Bayesian
We introduce the use of Bayesian Formalism in Neural Network.
We develop a Bayesian deep-learning network, "DPNNet-Bayesian," 
which can predict planet mass from disk gaps and also provides the 
uncertainties associated with the prediction. A unique feature of our
approach is that it is able to distinguish between the uncertainty 
associated with the deep-learning architecture and the uncertainty 
inherent in the input data due to measurement noise.
